# BMI-Calculator-BMI16
A simple Python script for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI). Users can input their weight and height, and the script computes the BMI and provides a health category classification (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity). 
Note: This is a basic script with no styling or graphical interface.
